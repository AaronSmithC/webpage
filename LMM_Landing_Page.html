        <h2>üß† What is a Large Movement Model?</h2>
        <p>
            A Large Movement Model (LMM) is a new class of AI system‚Äîtrained not on language or images,
            but on the deep patterns of human motion. Where language models predict words, LMMs predict
            posture, intent, and physical behavior‚Äîjoint by joint, frame by frame.
        </p>

        <h2>üì¶ Why it Matters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Animate realistic, expressive avatars</li>
            <li>Control wearable robotics and exosuits</li>
            <li>Detect motor disorders or asymmetries</li>
            <li>Power humanoid robots with adaptive motion</li>
            <li>Simulate real human behavior in digital worlds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üöÄ Why Now?</h2>
        <p>
            Three forces are converging: multiview motion data, biomechanics modeling, and 
            transformer-scale AI systems. Together, they make human-level motion understanding not just possible‚Äîbut inevitable.
        </p>

        <h2>üí° Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding movement is understanding people. We believe LMMs will be as foundational 
            to embodied intelligence as LLMs are to natural language.
        </p>

        <h2>üè∑Ô∏è Staking the Claim</h2>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúLarge Movement Model (LMM)‚Äù is a term we use at <strong>Aegis Station Infrastructure LLC</strong> to describe a new class of scalable, human-aware AI systems trained on real-world motion at scale.
            Aegis Station Infrastructure LLC is actively developing this concept as part of our broader work in scalable embodied intelligence.
