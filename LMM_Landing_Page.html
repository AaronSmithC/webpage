    <h2>What is a Large Movement Model?</h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">Large Movement Model (LMM)</span> is a general-purpose AI system built around
      human motion as its core data type. Instead of learning from words, LMM learns from
      <span class="highlight">sequences of movement</span>—patterns of joints, limbs, balance and timing—
      allowing it to recognize activities, forecast what comes next, and evaluate the quality of motion
      across many real-world settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it as “an LLM for motion”: a single model that can be adapted to digital health,
      safety, sports, robotics, and other domains where how people move actually matters.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Why Motion, Why Now?</h2>
    <p>
      Text, images, and audio all have mature foundation models. Human motion does not.
      Today, most systems that reason about movement are narrow, one-off solutions:
      one model for rehab, another for sports, another for security. LMM is designed to
      change that by treating motion itself as a first-class sequence domain.

      <span class="pill">Built for real environments</span>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Anchor Application Domains</h2>
    <p>
      We are actively developing and validating LMM across three anchor verticals, with
      additional domains to follow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Digital Health & Rehabilitation</strong> – Gait and balance analytics, compensation and fall-risk signatures, and objective progress tracking from routine rehab sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Security & Safety Intelligence</strong> – Motion-aware anomaly detection and behavior understanding for CCTV, with a focus on privacy-preserving, pose-based analysis instead of identity.</li>
      <li><strong>Sports Analytics</strong> – Biomechanics, fatigue and injury-risk indicators, and team-level motion patterns that drive spacing, effort, and game dynamics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The same underlying model family can also be adapted to <em>collaborative robotics,
      AR/VR avatars, human–AI interaction, and other embodied AI use cases</em> as the
      ecosystem matures.
    </p>

    <h2>How LMM Works (High Level)</h2>
    <p>
      LMM operates on normalized representations of human motion derived from video and
      other sensors. These sequences are turned into compact motion “tokens” that a
      transformer-style model can process, much like language tokens in an LLM. The model
      learns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How activities unfold over time (from micro-movements to longer behaviors)</li>
      <li>What constitutes physically plausible, biomechanically consistent motion</li>
      <li>How to predict near-term futures and complete partial or occluded motion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Implementation details—specific datasets, tokenization schemes, architectures, and
      training strategies—are part of our internal R&amp;D program and partner discussions.
    </p>

    <h2>Partnerships & Pilots</h2>
    <p>
      LMM is being developed by <strong>Aegis Station Infrastructure LLC</strong> as an early
      entrant in motion-centric foundation models. We’re currently:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building and testing LMM prototypes on curated motion datasets</li>
      <li>Exploring research collaborations with universities and labs</li>
      <li>Scoping pilot projects with organizations in rehab, security, and sports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are interested in partnering on research, pilots, or future licensing, we’d be
      glad to talk.
