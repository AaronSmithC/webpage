      <h1>Engage with Aegis</h1>
      <p>
        Whether you're an investor, a builder, or someone who believes space should belong to all of us—
        we're building something real, and we want the right people in the loop.
      </p>

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <h2>💼 Fund / Invest</h2>
        <p>We're preparing to raise support for early development phases. If you're serious about backing a permanent city in orbit—get in touch.</p>

        <h2>🔧 Build / Partner</h2>
        <p>Engineers, mission designers, logistics minds—if you’re building hardware or infrastructure that belongs in orbit, we’d like to talk.</p>

        <h2>🌍 Support the Mission</h2>
        <p>Share the project, follow its progress, or help us connect to those who can move it forward. Every signal matters.</p>

        <h2>🛰️ Policy & Access</h2>
        <p>If you're involved in space policy, public funding, or international access—your insight could shape how this unfolds. Let's connect.</p>
      </div>

        “I started Aegis because I was tired of space being theoretical. We know what to build. We know how to build it.
        Now we need the will—and the people—to make it happen.”<br>—A.S., Principal Architect
