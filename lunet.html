    <h1>LUNET</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      Lunar Utility Node &amp; Exchange Terminal<br>
      A standardized infrastructure for lunar mobility and ISRU integration
    </div>

    <p>
      The <strong>Lunar Utility Node &amp; Exchange Terminal (LUNET)</strong> is a standardized
      network of surface and orbital utility nodes designed to support routine, repeatable
      lunar transportation and operations. LUNET enables refueling, recharging, diagnostics,
      and logistics coordination for lunar surface and cislunar vehicles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than treating lunar mobility as a sequence of bespoke missions, LUNET establishes
      persistent infrastructure. It allows vehicles to carry only the propellant required for
      the next leg, enabling low-delta-v hops between nodes and supporting sustained operational cadence.
    </p>

           loading="lazy">
    </div>

    <h2>System Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Distributed surface and orbital utility nodes</li>
      <li>Refueling, recharging, diagnostics, and logistics exchange</li>
      <li>Designed for integration with lunar and orbital ISRU pipelines</li>
      <li>Independent of any single vehicle or station architecture</li>
      <li>Scalable from initial pathfinder nodes to full network coverage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ISRU-Aligned Operations</h2>
    <p>
      LUNET is designed around a water-buffered ISRU architecture. Water absorbs uncertainty
      and provides long-duration buffering, oxygen naturally lends itself to inventory,
      and hydrogen is treated as a short-dwell, near-use commodity rather than a bulk storage product.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach reduces power burden, tank mass, and system brittleness while improving
      operational resilience and scalability.
    </p>

    <h3>Water as the Network Commodity</h3>
    <p>
      A central architectural decision in LUNET is that water&mdash;not liquid hydrogen&mdash;is the
      commodity that moves through the network. Each node receives water deliveries and performs
      electrolysis and liquefaction locally. This converts a network-scale cryogenic logistics problem
      into a contained, node-local equipment problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water is the ideal transport commodity for lunar infrastructure: indefinitely stable with no
      boil-off, requiring no cryogenic insulation or vacuum-jacketed transfer lines, compatible with
      standard elastomeric seals and simple disconnectable fittings, storable in rigid tanks or flexible
      bladders, useful as radiation shielding while in storage, and presenting no explosion hazard.
    </p>

    <h2>Hydrogen Infrastructure Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Liquid hydrogen (LH<sub>2</sub>) presents unique infrastructure challenges at every stage: storage,
      transfer, and consumption. LUNET's architecture is designed around these constraints rather than
      attempting to overcome them through brute-force engineering.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Hydrogen Is Short-Dwell</h3>
    <p>
      The short-dwell principle is driven not only by boil-off losses but by the cumulative
      degradation of transfer infrastructure itself. LH<sub>2</sub> transfer lines degrade through
      thermal cycling fatigue (every fill/drain cycle between ambient and 20 K accumulates damage
      in bellows, flex joints, and bayonet connections), progressive hydrogen embrittlement at welds
      and heat-affected zones, vacuum jacket degradation as getter materials saturate and micro-leaks
      develop, and seal wear as PTFE cold-flows and spring-energized seals lose preload.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the lunar surface, replacing transfer lines is a major operation: warming, purging, joint
      breaking, seal replacement, leak checking, vacuum jacket re-evacuation, and re-cooling. The
      fewer times LH<sub>2</sub> is moved, and the shorter the dwell, the less infrastructure burden
      the network carries.
    </p>

    <h3>Produce Near, Consume Fast</h3>
    <p>
      Each LUNET node electrolyzes water and produces LH<sub>2</sub> locally, with a short cryogenic
      path from electrolyzer to liquefier to fill coupling&mdash;typically a few meters of plumbing.
      This is a fundamental differentiator from depot-centric architectures that assume bulk
      LH<sub>2</sub> movement across the lunar surface.
    </p>

    <h3>Node Design Implications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Co-locate electrolyzer, liquefier, and fill coupling with the shortest practical plumbing run</li>
      <li>Design fill interfaces for minimum disconnect cycles&mdash;direct fill from on-site production</li>
      <li>Stock seal consumables (indium gaskets, PTFE seal kits, spring-energized seal replacements) as standard logistics items</li>
      <li>Redundant fill lines at high-traffic nodes to avoid single-point failures</li>
      <li>Boil-off monitoring as standard node health telemetry</li>
      <li>Electrolyzer membrane spares as a planned maintenance item (PEM membranes: thousands of hours lifespan)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Node-Level Electrolysis and Power</h2>
    <p>
      PEM (proton exchange membrane) electrolyzers are inherently modular, commercially available
      from single-kilowatt to megawatt scale with identical core stack architecture. A LUNET node
      filling a rover with a few hundred kilograms of propellant between hops requires capacity on
      the order of a few kilowatts to approximately 20 kW&mdash;well within demonstrated hardware scale.
      Solid oxide electrolysis (SOEC) offers higher efficiency at high operating temperatures,
      potentially advantageous when co-located with thermal management systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Power Sizing Reference</h3>
    <p>
      Total node power requirements for the hydrogen production chain (electrolysis plus liquefaction)
      at different operational cadences, assuming a reference fill of 100 kg LH<sub>2</sub> per vehicle:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Fill Interval</th>
          <th>Electrolysis</th>
          <th>Liquefaction</th>
          <th>Total Power</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>14 days (1 per lunar day)</td><td>~16 kW</td><td>~7 kW</td><td>~23 kW</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3 days</td><td>~75 kW</td><td>~35 kW</td><td>~110 kW</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Daily fills</td><td>~230 kW</td><td>~104 kW</td><td>~334 kW</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Solar Array Sizing</h3>
    <p>
      Mid-latitude sites deliver approximately 200&ndash;250 W/m&sup2; from solar arrays (accounting
      for panel efficiency, packing factor, and dust degradation). Daytime-only production:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Fill Interval</th>
          <th>Power Required</th>
          <th>Array Area</th>
          <th>Approximate Size</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>14 days</td><td>~23 kW</td><td>~115 m&sup2;</td><td>~10 m &times; 12 m</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3 days</td><td>~110 kW</td><td>~550 m&sup2;</td><td>~23 m &times; 24 m</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Daily fills</td><td>~334 kW</td><td>~1,670 m&sup2;</td><td>~40 m &times; 42 m</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      A low-cadence node&mdash;serving a hopper every couple of weeks&mdash;runs its entire hydrogen
      production chain from roughly 115 m&sup2; of solar array, deployable from a single lander. As
      traffic grows, panels are added incrementally. The architecture scales linearly with demand.
    </p>

    <h3>Gaseous Hydrogen Alternative</h3>
    <p>
      Gaseous hydrogen propulsion eliminates the entire liquefaction chain at a specific impulse
      penalty of approximately 10&ndash;15%. For short surface hops between LUNET nodes, this trade
      may close favorably: slightly more propellant per hop in exchange for dramatically simpler and
      more reliable node infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h2>Resupply and Logistics</h2>
    <p>
      With node-level electrolysis and liquefaction, LUNET resupply simplifies to water delivery
      (from polar ISRU or Earth as backup, via simple unpressurized rovers and hoppers) plus
      maintenance consumables (electrolyzer membranes, cryogenic seal kits, power system maintenance
      items). These are compact, shelf-stable items that can be stockpiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      This converts the hardest problem in lunar propellant logistics&mdash;moving and storing liquid
      hydrogen&mdash;into the easiest one: moving and storing water.
    </p>

    <h2>Strategic Role</h2>
    <p>
      By decoupling vehicles from mission-complete propellant loads and enabling staged exchange
      across persistent nodes, LUNET transforms lunar ISRU from demonstration into daily operations
      that can be planned, relied upon, and scaled. Its distributed architecture is fundamentally
      more compatible with liquid hydrogen's constraints than a centralized depot model, requiring
      no long-distance cryogenic transfer lines and enabling incremental growth as traffic demands.
